This code is a deduction of Rusinkiewicz's paper for curvature estimation . 
Paper : Estimation of curvatures and their derivatives on triangle Meshes by Rusinkiewicz

In our case we don't go far to derivatives.

Trimesh is an open source python module dedicated to general mesh processing: 
https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh

This method of estimation is used so as many others existing in slam to estimate curvatures on the brain.
