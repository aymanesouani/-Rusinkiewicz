This code is a deduction of Rusinkiewicz's paper for curvature estimation . 
Paper : Estimation of curvatures and their derivatives on triangle Meshes by Rusinkiewicz

In our case we don't go far to derivatives. This code is a part of a Python module named slam.
https://github.com/gauzias/slam 

slam is a pure Python library for analysing and modeling surfaces represented as a triangular mesh. It is an extension of Trimesh, which is an open source python module dedicated to general mesh processing: 
https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh

This method of estimation is used so as many others existing in slam to estimate curvatures on the brain.

Requirements : 
  Trimesh
  Numpy
